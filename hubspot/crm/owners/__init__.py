    CRM Owners

    HubSpot uses **owners** to assign CRM objects to specific people in your organization. The endpoints described here are used to get a list of the owners that are available for an account. To assign an owner to an object, set the hubspot_owner_id property using the appropriate CRM object update or create a request.  If teams are available for your HubSpot tier, these endpoints will also indicate which team(s) an owner can access, as well as which team is the owner's primary team.  # noqa: E501
